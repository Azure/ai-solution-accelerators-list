# Azure OpenAI Accelerators and Demo Assets

The following is a list of Repeatable IP and learning resources to quickly build an initial Azure OpenAI solution, developed by different individuals and teams at Microsoft.

## Accelerators

Below is a summary list of the Azure OpenAI IP/reusable assets:
<br/>


| Name      | Description   | Link   |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Knowledge Mining with Azure OpenAI | The purpose of this repo is to accelerate the deployment of a Python-based Knowledge Mining solution with OpenAI that will ingest a Knowledge Base, generate embeddings using the contents extracted, store them in a vector search engine (Redis), and use that engine to answer queries / questions specific to that Knowledge Base.| [Link](https://github.com/samelhousseini/km-openai)
| Azure OpenAI Embeddings QnA | A simple web application for a OpenAI-enabled document search. This repo uses Azure OpenAI Service for creating embeddings vectors from documents. For answering the question of a user, it retrieves the most relevant document and then uses GPT-3 to extract the matching answer for the question. | [Link](https://github.com/ruoccofabrizio/azure-open-ai-embeddings-qna)
| Azure OpenAI Workshop |  In this workshop, you will learn how to use the Azure OpenAI service to create AI powered solutions. You will get hands-on experience with the latest AI technologies and will learn how to use Azure OpenAI API. | [Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openai-workshop)
| OpenAI in a Day workshop | This technical workshop will provide an introduction to OpenAI and an overview of Azure OpenAI Studio. Participants will be prompted to complete engineering exercises and use OpenAI to access company data. They will also learn about embedding solution accelerators and prototyping one use case from start to finish.| [Link](https://github.com/csiebler/openai-in-a-day)
| OpenAI workshop | Workshop materials to build intelligent solutions on Open AI | [Link](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenAIWorkshop)
| Business Process Automation solution accelerator | Creates pipelines to analyze text and audio datasets, across multiple cognitive services, and the HuggingFace library. The accelerator deploys all of the resources, and transforms the input data at each step, allowing multiple Cognitive Services to be called and deployed within a single, end-to-end pipeline. Includes capabilities like Azure OpenAI (summarization or custom prompts) and integration with CosmosDb, Cognitive Search, and RediSearch for Vector Search  | [Link](https://github.com/Azure/business-process-automation)
| GPT3 Prompt Examples | GPT-3 examples using mostly text-davinci-003 | [Link](https://gist.github.com/csiebler/d137386c4a63cc34810151bcdf150d54)
| Simple Chatbot using Azure OpenAI service | Step-by-step  article describing  how to create a  chatbot based on the Azure OpenAI text-davinci model.| [Link](https://github.com/michalmar/openai-demos-bot-webapp)
|Azure OpenAI Example Prompts |This repository shares example code and example prompts for accomplishing common tasks with the Azure OpenAI API.| [Link](https://github.com/jakeatmsft/AzureOpenAIExamples)
|Document Analysis using OpenAI GPT-3 |This repository provides a set of examples in Jupyter Notebooks/Python for performing document analysis using Azure OpenAI's GPT-3 | [Link](https://github.com/ryubidragonfire/document-analysis-using-gpt-3)
|Azure OpenAI integration with Azure Cognitive-Search for document analysis | Azure OpenAI integration as a custom skillset in Azure Cognitive Search | [Link](https://github.com/Anaig/OpenAI-and-Cognitive-Search/)
|ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search | This sample demonstrates a few approaches for creating ChatGPT-like experiences over your own data using the Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern. It uses Azure OpenAI Service to access the ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo), and Azure Cognitive Search for data indexing and retrieval. **NOTE: sample created by Product Group**| [Link](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo/)
|GPT-Azure-Search-Engine | This repo shows how you can use Azure OpenAI + Azure Cognitive Search to have a Smart and Multilingual Search engine that not only provides links of the search results, but also answers the question. | [Link](https://github.com/pablomarin/GPT-Azure-Search-Engine)
|Visual ChatGPT |Visual ChatGPT connects ChatGPT and a series of Visual Foundation Models to enable sending and receiving images during chatting. | [Link](https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt)
|Azure Cognitive Semantic Search with OpenAI enrichment |Azure Cognitive Semantic Search that works on large documents, with OpenAI enrichment. | [Link](https://github.com/MaheshSQL/cognitive-semantic-search-openai-accelerator)
|Podcast Synopsis with OpenAI GPT|This repo illustrates how to use OpenAI GPT to generate a synopsis from a podcast transcription into multiple languages,
generate 2-3 tag lines based on the podcast content and generate search engine optimised (SEO) keywords.| [Link](https://github.com/ryubidragonfire/generate-podcast-synopsis-OpenAI-GPT)
