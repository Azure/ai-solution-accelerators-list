# Azure OpenAI Accelerators and Demo Assets

Repeatable IP and learning resources to quickly build an initial Azure OpenAI solution.


## Accelerators

Below is a summary list of the Azure OpenAI IP/reusable assets:
<br/>


| Name      | Description   | Link   |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Azure OpenAI Embeddings QnA | A simple web application for a OpenAI-enabled document search. This repo uses Azure OpenAI Service for creating embeddings vectors from documents. For answering the question of a user, it retrieves the most relevant document and then uses GPT-3 to extract the matching answer for the question. | [Link](https://github.com/ruoccofabrizio/azure-open-ai-embeddings-qna)
| Azure OpenAI Workshop |  In this workshop, you will learn how to use the Azure OpenAI service to create AI powered solutions. You will get hands-on experience with the latest AI technologies and will learn how to use Azure OpenAI API. | [Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openai-workshop)
| OpenAI in a Day workshop | This technical workshop will provide an introduction to OpenAI and an overview of Azure OpenAI Studio. Participants will be prompted to complete engineering exercises and use OpenAI to access company data. They will also learn about embedding solution accelerators and prototyping one use case from start to finish.| [Link](https://github.com/csiebler/openai-in-a-day)
| Business Process Automation solution accelerator | Creates pipelines to analyze text and audio datasets, across multiple cognitive services, and the HuggingFace library. The accelerator deploys all of the resources, and transforms the input data at each step, allowing multiple Cognitive Services to be called and deployed within a single, end-to-end pipeline. Includes capabilities like Azure OpenAI (summarization or custom prompts) and integration with CosmosDb, Cognitive Search, and RediSearch for Vector Search  | [Link](https://github.com/Azure/business-process-automation)
| GPT3 Prompt Examples | GPT-3 examples using mostly text-davinci-003 | [Link](https://gist.github.com/csiebler/d137386c4a63cc34810151bcdf150d54)
| Simple Chatbot using Azure OpenAI service | Step-by-step  article describing  how to create a  chatbot based on the Azure OpenAI text-davinci model.| [Link](https://github.com/michalmar/openai-demos-bot-webapp)
|OpenAI Example Prompts |This repository shares example code and example prompts for accomplishing common tasks with the Azure OpenAI API.| [Link](https://github.com/jakeatmsft/AzureOpenAIExamples)
|Document Analysis using OpenAI GPT-3 |This repository provides a set of examples in Jupyter Notebooks/Python for performing document analysis using OpenAI's GPT-3 *(note: uses OpenAI directly, not Azure OpenAI)* | [Link](https://github.com/ryubidragonfire/document-analysis-using-gpt-3)
