| Name      | Description   | Link   |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Azure OpenAI Embeddings QnA | A simple web application for a OpenAI-enabled document search. This repo uses Azure OpenAI Service for creating embeddings vectors from documents. For answering the question of a user, it retrieves the most relevant document and then uses GPT-3 to extract the matching answer for the question. | [Link](https://github.com/ruoccofabrizio/azure-open-ai-embeddings-qna)
| Azure OpenAI Workshop |  In this workshop, you will learn how to use the Azure OpenAI service to create AI powered solutions. You will get hands-on experience with the latest AI technologies and will learn how to use Azure OpenAI API. | [Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openai-workshop)
| Business Process Automation | Creates pipelines to analyze text and audio datasets, across multiple cognitive services, and the HuggingFace library. The accelerator deploys all of the resources, and transforms the input data at each step, allowing multiple Cognitive Services to be called and deployed within a single, end-to-end pipeline. | [Link](https://github.com/Azure/business-process-automation)
